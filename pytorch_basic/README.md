# PyTorch Basics

This directory contains fundamental PyTorch examples and basic neural network implementations for learning the framework essentials.

## Contents

- `my_model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with basic PyTorch model examples

## Purpose

This section serves as an introduction to PyTorch fundamentals before diving into the more complex architectures in other directories. It covers:

### Basic PyTorch Concepts:
- Tensor operations and manipulations
- Automatic differentiation with autograd
- Building simple neural networks
- Training loops and optimization

### Getting Started:
```bash
jupyter notebook my_model.ipynb
```

## Learning Path

Start here if you're new to PyTorch, then progress to:
1. **LeNet From Scratch** - Basic CNN implementation
2. **Backpropagation From Scratch** - Understanding the fundamentals
3. **More advanced architectures** - Transformer, VAE, etc.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchvision jupyter matplotlib numpy
```

This foundation will prepare you for the more advanced implementations in the other project directories.
