# PyTorch Introduction Slides

This directory contains the PyTorch introduction notebook that has been converted to slideshow format.

## üéØ What's Included

- **`pytorch_introduction.ipynb`** - Main notebook with slideshow metadata
- **`SLIDES_README.md`** - This instruction file
- **`convert_to_slides.py`** - Script used for conversion (can be deleted)

## üöÄ How to Present the Slides

### Method 1: Using Jupyter's Built-in Slideshow (Recommended)

1. **Install RISE extension** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install RISE
   jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
   jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix
   ```

2. **Open the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pytorch_introduction.ipynb
   ```

3. **Start slideshow**: Click the "Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow" button in the toolbar, or press `Alt+R`

4. **Navigate slides**:
   - **Next slide**: `Space` or `Right Arrow`
   - **Previous slide**: `Shift+Space` or `Left Arrow`
   - **Exit slideshow**: `Esc`

### Method 2: Using nbconvert

Convert to static HTML slides:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert pytorch_introduction.ipynb --to slides --post serve
```

This will create an HTML file and open it in your browser.

### Method 3: Export to PDF (for sharing)

```bash
jupyter nbconvert pytorch_introduction.ipynb --to slides --post serve --no-input
```

## üìã Slide Structure

The presentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **Title Slide** - Introduction and overview
2. **Setup** - Import statements and environment check
3. **Tensors** - Fundamental PyTorch data structures
4. **Autograd** - Automatic differentiation system
5. **Neural Networks** - Building models with nn.Module
6. **Loss Functions** - MSE, CrossEntropy, and more
7. **Training Example** - Complete end-to-end workflow
8. **Model Persistence** - Saving and loading models
9. **Summary** - Key takeaways and next steps

## üé® Presentation Tips

### During the Presentation:

1. **Start with the big picture** - Use the title slide to set expectations
2. **Run code cells live** - Press `Shift+Enter` to execute cells during the presentation
3. **Engage with output** - Discuss results and visualizations as they appear
4. **Use fragments** - Some code examples are set as fragments for incremental reveal

### For Interactive Sessions:

- The notebook is designed to be run cell-by-cell
- All code examples are self-contained
- Feel free to modify parameters and re-run cells
- Use the training example as a hands-on exercise

### Customization Options:

The slides are configured with:
- **White theme** for better projection
- **Slide transitions** for smooth navigation
- **Progress bar** to show presentation progress
- **Slide numbers** for easy reference
- **Chalkboard** for annotation (if RISE is used)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Slide Types Used:
- **slide** - Main section headers
- **subslide** - Subsections within a topic
- **fragment** - Code examples that appear incrementally

### RISE Configuration:
The notebook includes optimized settings for presentation:
- Centered content disabled for better code display
- Scroll enabled for long outputs
- Controls and progress bar enabled
- Chalkboard available for annotations

## üìö Using This for Teaching

This slideshow is perfect for:
- **University courses** on deep learning or PyTorch
- **Workshop presentations** at conferences
- **Corporate training** sessions
- **Self-study** with a structured approach

### Recommended Timing:
- **Full presentation**: 60-90 minutes
- **Core concepts only**: 30-45 minutes
- **Hands-on workshop**: 2-3 hours with exercises

## üîß Troubleshooting

### RISE Extension Issues:
```bash
# Reinstall RISE
pip uninstall rise
pip install rise
jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix --overwrite
jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix
```

### Matplotlib Plots Not Showing:
Make sure you have the inline backend enabled:
```python
%matplotlib inline
```

### Performance Issues:
- Close other Jupyter notebooks
- Restart the kernel before presenting
- Reduce figure sizes if memory is limited

## üìù Notes

- The original notebook functionality is preserved
- All code cells remain executable
- The conversion script can be used to update slide metadata if needed
- Consider installing additional extensions like `nbextensions` for enhanced functionality
