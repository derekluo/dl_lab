@linear_from_scratch/ review and refactor to concise 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to review and refactor the linear_from_scratch folder to make it more concise. Let me start by understanding what's currently in this folder and how it's organized.

From the project layout, I can see the linear_from_scratch folder contains:
- __pycache__/ (Python cache directory)
- data/ (with various data files and results)
- generate_data.py (4.2KB, 122 lines)
- inference.py (5.2KB, 151 lines) 
- loss_curve.png
- model.py (397B, 13 lines)
- README.md (5.8KB, 161 lines)
- train.py (3.3KB, 93 lines)
- training_result.png

The user currently has generate_data.py open and focused. To provide a comprehensive review and refactoring, I should:

1. First read all the key files to understand the current structure and code
2. Identify opportunities for refactoring to make things more concise
3. Look for code duplication, unnecessary complexity, overly verbose documentation, etc.
4. Create a plan for refactoring
5. Implement the refactoring

Let me start by reading the key files in parallel to understand the current state.</details></think>

I'll review and refactor the linear_from_scratch project to make it more concise. Let me start by examining the current code structure.
