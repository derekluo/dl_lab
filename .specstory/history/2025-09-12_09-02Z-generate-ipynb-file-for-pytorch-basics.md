<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to generate a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) to introduce PyTorch basics in the pytorch_basic folder. Let me first look at what already exists in that folder to see if there are any existing files I should be aware of.

From the project layout, I can see there's already:
- README.md (2.4KB, 46 lines)  
- my_model.ipynb (5.3KB, 173 lines)

Let me read the existing files to understand what's already there before creating a new introduction notebook.</details></think>

I'll help you create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook to introduce PyTorch basics. Let me first check what already exists in the pytorch_basic folder, then create a new introduction notebook.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see there's already a basic notebook `my_model.ipynb` that covers some fundamental concepts, but it's quite simple and only covers basic model creation and saving/loading. The README suggests this is meant to be an introduction to PyTorch basics.

Looking at the existing notebook, it covers:
- Basic model definition with nn.Module
- Layer initialization
- Forward pass
- Sequential modules
- State dict and model saving/loading

However, for a comprehensive introduction to PyTorch basics, I should create a more detailed notebook that covers more fundamental concepts like:
- Tensors and basic operations
- Autograd and gradients
- Different types of layers
- Loss functions
- Optimizers
- Training loops
- Data loading
- Device handling (CPU/GPU)

I'll create a new comprehensive notebook called `pytorch_introduction.ipynb` that covers all the essential PyTorch basics while complementing the existing simple model example.</details></think>
