<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to generate a CLIP model implementation from scratch. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network that can learn visual concepts from natural language supervision. It consists of two main components:

1. An image encoder (typically a Vision Transformer or ResNet)
2. A text encoder (typically a transformer)

These two encoders are trained together using contrastive learning to align image and text representations in a shared embedding space.

I need to create a new directory `clip_from_scratch/` and implement:
1. The CLIP model architecture
2. Training script
3. Inference script 
4. README file
5. Possibly some utility files

Let me start by creating the directory structure and implementing the core components.

I should create a todo list to track the tasks:
1. Create directory structure
2. Implement the CLIP model (image encoder + text encoder + contrastive loss)
3. Create training script
4. Create inference script
5. Create README
6. Test the implementation

Let me start with the todo list and then begin implementation.</details></think>

I'll help you create a CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) implementation from scratch. Let me break this down into manageable tasks and create the implementation.

---

## Todo List

- [-] Create clip_from_scratch directory structure
- [ ] Implement CLIP model with image and text encoders
- [ ] Create training script with contrastive loss
- [ ] Create inference script for testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Test the complete implementation

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I'll start by creating the directory structure and implementing the CLIP model. Let me start by creating the directory:</details></think>

---

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/rodin/Workspace/algovate/dl_lab/clip_from_scratch
```

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now let me mark the directory creation as complete and start implementing the CLIP model. I'll create the model.py file first with the core CLIP architecture.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Create clip_from_scratch directory structure
- [-] Implement CLIP model with image and text encoders
- [ ] Create training script with contrastive loss
- [ ] Create inference script for testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] Test the complete implementation

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I'll implement the CLIP model. CLIP consists of:
1. An image encoder (I'll use a Vision Transformer approach)
2. A text encoder (Transformer-based)
3. Contrastive loss for training

Let me create the model.py file:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to continue creating the CLIP implementation from scratch. I see that there was an attempt to create a model.py file that got deleted, so I need to continue with the implementation. Let me create the CLIP model architecture first.

I need to implement:
1. CLIP model with image and text encoders
2. Training script with contrastive loss
3. Inference script for testing
4. README with examples

Let me start with the model implementation.</details></think>

I'll continue implementing the CLIP model from scratch. Let me start with the core model architecture:
